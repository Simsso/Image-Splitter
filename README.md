# Poker Card Image Manipulation Tools
This repository consists of three image manipulation tools which were developed for poker card image manipulation. The primary project is the Image Splitter.

## Image Splitter
Splits an image into many images of the same shape (width and height).

The screenshot shows how a photo of a poker card deck is split into 52 single images.

## Image Resizer
Resizes all images in a given input folder to the desired dimensions and subsequently saves them to the output folder.

## Mosaic Creator
Creates an image mosaic out of many single, randomly chosen images. The random images are taken from a directory and all its subdirectories.

The screenshot shows a mosaic which was created out of 144 poker card images.
